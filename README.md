# What is this?
A WebExtension to make Chrome appear like it's running on Windows

## Why?
Because it seemed to me like Microsoft O365 was logging me out after just
a few hours, while it didn't seem to happen to anyone else. The only thing
I could think of was that they were treating me differently because I'm
using Linux. Tricking them to think I was using Windows landed me in in the
good fellowship of staying logged in for days again.
